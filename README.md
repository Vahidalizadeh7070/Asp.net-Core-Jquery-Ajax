# Asp.net-Core-Jquery-Ajax
This repository is going to perform a CRUD operation using .Net core and Jquery ajax.
In this repo, The Entityframework Core is used beside the jquery ajax to show the notification of all messeges to users. Moreover The bootstrap is used to implement the user interface and we use also the rating bar to implement a rating system which is a mandatory section of an application. You can extend it and implement any kind of design pattern to handle the CRUD operation.

<h3>We have used:</h3>

- Entityframework Core InMemory : <code>Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory -Version 5.0.1</code>
- ToastNotification 1.1.0 : <code>Install-Package AspNetCoreHero.ToastNotification -Version 1.1.0</code>
- JQuery : <code> Install-Package jQuery -Version 3.5.1</code>
- Bootstrap : <code>Install-Package bootstrap -Version 5.1.3</code>

In the End as we mentioned the main purpose of this example is that how to implement a CRUD application using Jquery Ajax in a dot net core application, therefore you can expand it and reform it as you like.
